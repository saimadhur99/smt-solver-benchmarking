# smt-solver-benchmarking

To download and integrate the SMT solvers Yices, Z3, and CVC5 into a Python environment, you can follow these steps for each solver. Make sure you have Python installed on your system before you start.

### Step 1: Install Python (if not already installed)

Ensure Python and pip (Python’s package installer) are installed. You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Z3

Z3 is one of the easiest SMT solvers to install with Python due to its support through pip. Here’s how to install it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install z3-solver
   ```

### Step 3: Install CVC5

CVC5 can be installed using pip as well. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install cvc5
   ```

### Step 4: Install Yices

Yices does not have an official pip package, so it requires a few more steps to use with Python:

1. **Download Yices:**
   - Go to the [Yices download page](https://yices.csl.sri.com/download.shtml).
   - Select the appropriate version for your operating system.
   - Follow the instructions to download and extract the files.

2. **Set Environment Variables (optional but recommended):**
   - Add the Yices `bin` directory to your system’s PATH environment variable. This allows you to run Yices from any command prompt or terminal window.
   - For Windows, this can usually be done via System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables.
   - For macOS and Linux, you can add a line to your shell configuration file (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`): `export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/yices/bin"`

3. **Using Yices from Python:**
   - Since there’s no direct Python API distributed through PyPI, you can interact with Yices through system calls from Python using the `subprocess` module or similar methods. Here’s a basic example:
     ```python
     import subprocess

     # Example command to check Yices version
     result = subprocess.run(["yices", "--version"], capture_output=True, text=True)
     print(result.stdout)
     ```

### Step 5: Verify Installation

After installation, verify that each solver is working correctly by querying their versions or running a simple problem. For Z3 and CVC5, you can use Python directly to create a simple test script. For Yices, you may test it via the command line or using system calls in Python as shown above.

By following these steps, you should have Z3, CVC5, and Yices set up in your Python environment, ready for tackling various computational logic and verification tasks.

### Step 6: Run the Python File

Run the file: Type python <file_name>.py or python3 <file_name>.py (replacing filename.py with the name of the Python file, such as hello.py) and press Enter:
